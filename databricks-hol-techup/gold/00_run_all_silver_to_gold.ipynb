    "## Process Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Customer Metrics Generation\n",
    "   - Creates detailed customer analytics\n",
    "   - Includes purchase behavior, segmentation, and lifetime value metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Product Performance Analysis\n",
    "   - Analyzes product sales and performance\n",
    "   - Includes inventory metrics and customer behavior patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Sales Summary Creation\n",
    "   - Comprehensive sales analytics\n",
    "   - Daily aggregations with various dimensions\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Inventory Insights\n",
    "   - Stock level analysis\n",
    "   - Demand patterns and optimization metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "## Execution Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "- The notebook uses adaptive query optimization\n",
    "- Tables are created using the Iceberg table format\n",
    "- Each section includes progress logging\n",
    "- Final optimization and statistics computation is performed on all tables\n"
